This repository demonstrates a subtle timing-related bug in HTML and Javascript.  The `myFunction` attempts to modify the `innerHTML` of a div element before the element is fully rendered by the browser. This can lead to unexpected results, such as the element not being updated as expected or Javascript errors. The solution demonstrates how to properly manage script execution timing to avoid this issue.
